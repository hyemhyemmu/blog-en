# 01. AI Will Greatly Change the Future of Learning

Since the emergence of ChatGPT, I have been using it for learning and gradually realized that this tool will significantly transform the way we approach education in the future.

### 1. Instant Feedback and Iterative Learning

When asking questions, AI can provide immediate answers, greatly reducing the time spent searching and filtering information through traditional search engines. Moreover, AI’s language organization is highly fluent, creating an interactive experience. The word "iteration" perfectly describes this process—through effective prompts, AI not only answers questions but also raises new ones, allowing for deeper exploration of knowledge points. While studying the APS110 course, I frequently adopted this approach. After class, I always had numerous questions. Although I could ask my professor, the delay and limited opportunities for follow-up made AI’s immediacy a perfect complement.

### 2. Personalized Learning

Most language models have memory capabilities. As conversations progress, AI becomes increasingly accurate in constructing a user profile, tailoring responses to individual learning habits and styles. This makes AI-powered learning highly personalized—content, teaching style, and pace can all be customized, truly realizing the concept of "teaching according to ability." Learning has never been this efficient!

### 3. Transforming the Nature of Exams

Standardized exams may eventually be replaced, especially those relying on rote memorization, as such skills hold little competitive value in the AI era. One drawback of standardized tests is that their fairness is often procedural but fails to accurately reflect a candidate’s true abilities. They may even be biased by the preferences of test designers, which contradicts the original intent of standardized assessments. In the future, critical thinking and creativity will likely become the most valuable skills, and evaluation systems should evolve accordingly. Additionally, language models can identify patterns that humans might overlook, ensuring a more objective and fair assessment by eliminating the inconsistency of traditional standardized exams.
